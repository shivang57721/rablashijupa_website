# Introduction 
Since the dawn of time, humanity had to face his worst flaw ever : his dying thirst to knowledge.
Hofstede cultural dimensions model, originally published in the 1970s, is a key tool for understanding cultural differences among countries. The cultures of each country are characterised by 6 scores : “Power Distance”, “Uncertainty Avoidance”, “Masculinity-Femininity”, “Long Term Orientation”, “Individualism”, “Indulgence”. 
This project aims at identifying the extent to which Wikipedia pageview trends across countries reflect the cultural values defined by Hofstede. Culture being defined as a set of values firmly anchored within a group of people, we will assume that each country's culture is stable over a 3-year window. 

The Hofstede dimensions are defined as such by its original author:

1. **Power Distance**, related to the different solutions to the basic problem of human inequality

2. **Uncertainty Avoidance**, related to the level of stress in a society in the face of an unknown future

3. **Individualism versus Collectivism**, related to the integration of individuals into primary groups

4. **Masculinity versus Femininity**, related to the division of emotional roles between women and men

5. **Long Term versus Short Term Orientation**, related to the choice of focus for people's efforts: the future or the present and past.

6. **Indulgence versus Restraint**, related to the gratification versus control of basic human desires related to enjoying life
