# Conclusion

Our study allowed us to better understand to what extent Wikipedia pageviews can define cultural aspect's defined by Hofstede's dimensions. We were able to link countries between each other based on these pageviews. Moreover, we were able to see how Covid affected people's interest during that period. Furthermore, we managed to investigate the potential correlation between technology use and access habits and cultural interests by comparing pageview patterns for different topics and by using machine learning methods to Cluster countries in groups according to their average ICT Access and Usage, Wikipedia pageviews and Hofstede dimensions.
