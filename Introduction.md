## Abstract: 
Hofstede cultural dimensions model, originally published in the 1970s, is a key tool for understanding cultural differences among countries. The cultures of each country are characterised by 6 scores : “Power Distance”, “Uncertainty Avoidance”, “Masculinity-Femininity”, “Long Term Orientation”, “Individualism”, “Indulgence”. 
This project aims at identifying the extent to which Wikipedia pageview trends across countries reflect the cultural values defined by Hofstede. Culture being defined as a set of values firmly anchored within a group of people, we will assume that each country's culture is stable over a 3-year window. We will thus:
 - Link some of the topics to one of the dimensions of the Hofstede model.
